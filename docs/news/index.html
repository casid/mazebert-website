                        <div class="post-content-text">It is with a heavy heart that I must share some difficult news with all of you. After much consideration, I have made the regretful decision to step away from the development of Mazebert TD, marking the end of its journey.

For the past decade, Mazebert TD has been my passion project. I have dedicated countless hours to refining gameplay, introducing new features, and ensuring a seamless experience across Android, iOS, and Windows platforms. Your unwavering support and enthusiasm have been the driving force behind my dedication.

However, the toll of maintaining the server and updating the apps has become overwhelming. As a lone developer, I have reached a point of burnout where I must prioritize my own well-being. Therefore, I'm removing the game from the app stores in the next days. This means that no new users will be able to download the app. As of August 1st, 2023, I will be shutting down the Mazebert TD server and the online functionality will cease to exist.

I want to express my deepest gratitude to each and every one of you who has been a part of this incredible community. Your feedback, bug reports, and suggestions have been invaluable in shaping the game. I have been humbled by the friendships and connections that have blossomed within this community.

I apologize for any disappointment or inconvenience this decision may cause. It was not taken lightly. Sometimes, in order to move forward, we must make difficult choices and let go of what has become an integral part of our lives.

Thank you for being a part of this incredible journey!

Cheers,
Andy

PS: I have decided to open source the core simulation of Mazebert TD. For those of you who are interested, you will have the opportunity to continue the game's legacy. Whether it's making a client with better graphics, adding 3D models, or even using the source code as inspiration for your own tower defense game, I hope this will provide a platform for further creativity and innovation within the community.</div>

                        <div class="post-content-text">I'm very sad to announce that there will be no season this December.

I had a few things planned for a balancing season. The idea was to do a small update and buff underused/underperforming cards. But whenever I sat down after work at my computer, I couldn't get stuff done. I felt bad releasing just a small update without actual new content, which would waste a lot of your time just playtesting balancing adjustments. So I have nothing that's worth releasing this year and I'm very sorry to let you down! It seems I really needed a little break from working on the game.

That being said, next year Mazebert TD is going to turn 10 years old. I'd love to celebrate this with a content update / season that's worth playing.

The theme of next season will be a new type of towers: Water towers.

Water towers can only be built on water tiles, not on land. Each water tower you build, will reduce the amount of your possible land towers by one. Water towers will be added to all current elements of the game. For instance, a Nature water tower could be a Blue Whale, while a Metro water tower could be a Battle Ship.

In case you have ideas for water towers, I'd be very happy if you post them in the forum under <a href="https://mazebert.com/forum/ideas/">card ideas</a>. As always, you will be mentioned as author on the card and in the credits, for any tower idea that gets implemented.

I'd also still like to buff some underperforming cards together with next year's big content update. You know the game much better than I do, so very happy about any suggestions on that front, too.

I wish all of you a pleasent and relaxing Christmas time!
